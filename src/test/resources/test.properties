### Test configuration file for java-jersey-wishlist ###

# All properties defined here are available as place-holders in the Spring application context at:
#
#   META-INF/applicationContext.xml
#
# Properties defined here can thus be referenced in Spring using the ${} notation. E.g., property PROP will
# be available as ${PROP}.
#
# Note that the values that are defined here in test.properties are always overriding the default.properties and can be overridden by either:
#
#   - Java system properties,
#   - or environment variables.
#
# This is useful to inject configuration values that are specific to the test execution.
